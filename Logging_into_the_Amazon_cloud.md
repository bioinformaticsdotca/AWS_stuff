### Logging into the Amazon Cloud <a id="amazon_cloud"></a>

* These instructions will **ONLY** be relevant in class, as the Cloud will not be accessible from home in advance of the class.
 
* On the cloud, we're going to use the default username: **ubuntu**

* Make sure the permissions on your certificate are secure. Use chmod on your downloaded certificate:

```bash
 chmod 600 CBWCG.pem
```

* To log in to the node, use the -i command line argument to specify your certificate:

```bash
 ssh -i CBWCG.pem ubuntu@cbw##.dyndns.info
```

(where ## is your assigned student number. Your student number is the number on your name badge. If your number is less than 10, please add 0 in front of it.)

##### Copying files to your computer
* To copy files from an instance, use scp in a similar fashion:

```bash
 scp -i CBWCG.pem ubuntu@cbw##.dyndns.info:<file name> .
```

* Everything created in your workspace on the cloud is also available by a web server on your cloud instance.  Simply go to the following in your browser:

 http://cbw##.dyndns.info/ http://cbw#.dyndns.info/

#### File System Layout <a id="file_system_layout"></a>
<br>
When you log in, you'll notice that you have two directories: **CourseData** and **workspace**.

* The **CourseData** directory will contain the files that you'll need to complete your lab assignments.

* The **workspace** directory is where we will keep our temporary files. By default, we have around 40 GB available for our output files in the workspace directory. If you run out of space, you may need to delete some files from this directory.
